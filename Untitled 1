We have n orchards and m varieties
each orchard has a size
each variety needs a space
some varieties are incompatible

we want to maximize the number of varieties planted

sum of the number of orchards in which a variety is planted <= 1
no incompatible varieties in the same orchard
sum of required spaces of varieties planted in an orchard <= orchard size

VERTEX OF VG:

index that indicates the variety to be planted (or not)
accumulator, list  that indicates the number of varieties planted in each orchard
accumulator, list that indicates the space left in each orchard

EDGE OF VG: 

action, integer that indicates in which orchard is planted, or null/-1 if not planted
weight, boolean (integer 0 or 1) that indicates if it has been planted or not (action is different than null/-1)

VG OF TYPE LAST
To compute actions, we need to know space left in each orchard
